      <h1><b>About us</b></h1>
      <p>
        We are Zefi & Luana, and this is our second project for the bootcamp
        Full-stack Web Development Ironhack. 
        
        Zefi is a Greek digital archivist
        living in Amsterdam since many years (we won't count how many :P)
        learning coding to enhance her skills to be able to improve the way
        digital archives preservation is handled today.

        Luana is an Italian
        living in Paris since few years (idem, we won't count the time) working
        in tech as Project Manager and pivoting on a Product Management role,
        she decided to learn coding to better understand the work of the teams
        she collaborates with. 
        
        This project is all around books and the love for
        readings that many people share as a passion. The idea was to offer a
        platform to share this passion allowing other people borrowing and
        appreciating the readings of our heart. The hope is to fuel the creation
        of a community of passionate of readings, of every genre of books, that
        take this opportunity to discover new opus and discuss about their
        favourites. This is an MVP that can be largely improved. Our vision for
        improvements: adding localisation and being able to filter available
        books to borerow around you, creating a forum to discuss, adding books
        to your favourites, being able to follow other users to be updated on
        their activities, organise events...many other possibilities are opened!
        Enjoy!
